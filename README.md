# Sandbox
Place to try Github related things

# Maven
Please install maven (as it will be taught during the course).
We will be using it to automate the compilation in an IDE independent way, and
to help with the testing setup.

## If on the command line
- To build a maven project, `mvn package`

- To test, `mvn test`

- To clean, `mvn clean`

Feel free to test out things and modify this App in your own branch, and try
out pull requests.
